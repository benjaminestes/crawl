    "\n",
    "`crawl` assumes you'll use BigQuery for analysis. The implementation is flexible, so it shouldn't be hard to get it working with other tools. This notebook assumes you understand the basics of BigQuery. It is a tutorial on how to interpret the schema of `crawl`'s output. For some quick recipes, check out the [SQL](https://github.com/benjaminestes/crawl/tree/master/sql) folder in the GitHub repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't used BigQuery from the command-line or from Python before, you'll need to configure the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) before continuing. I'll assume you've run a crawl and uploaded your data to BigQuery. To make things easier, we'll use the BigQuery Jupyter extension. The queries will use BigQuery's [Standard SQL](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/) dialect."
